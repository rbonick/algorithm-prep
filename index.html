<h1>Algorithm Prep Guide</h1>

<p>
    Recently I've spent some time re-learning my data structures and algorithms.
    I've put together a bit of a study guide / cheat sheet that sums up the
    important details (runtime, etc.) and includes implementations when
    possible. It should come in handy for anyone who wants to brush up on their
    knowledge or for interview preparation.

<h4>Contents</h1>
<ol class="post-list">
    {% for page in site.contents %}
      <li>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ page.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ page.title | escape }}</a>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ol>
